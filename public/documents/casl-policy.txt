Canada's Anti-Spam Legislation (CASL)
Metanova Tech Private Limited and/or its associated companies (collectively referred to as "Metanova Tech") Policy Statement. This document delineates the policy of Metanova Tech and aims to provide reasonable assurance that (i) a consistent process is adhered to concerning the distribution of commercial electronic messages (CEMs) to Metanova Tech clients and prospective clients in Canada, and (ii) Metanova Tech employees sending commercial electronic messages from and/or to computer systems in Canada comply with the requirements of CASL.

The Metanova Tech Anti-Spam Policy ("Anti-Spam Policy") and associated procedures (the "CASL Procedures") mandate that all Metanova Tech employees sending CEMs from and/or to computer systems in Canada or to an electronic address that will be accessed from a computer system in Canada comply with CASL. This policy also aims to ensure that all CEMs sent by or on behalf of Metanova Tech, or using a Metanova Tech email address or device, adhere to CASL.
